# Changelog

All notable structural execution mapping bounds tracking changes over the life cycle of the Blood Management System REST API will be inherently documented sequentially here.

This format explicitly mimics [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), strictly adhering functionally to structural [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Multi-Stage Docker Build Engine (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`).
- Integration Test runner checking Fargate ALBs `Health API` endpoints mapping safely directly natively.

---

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Integrated native `/api/docs` routing seamlessly wrapping Next.js Server boundaries generating an interactive **Swagger OpenAPI 3.0** documentation suite.
- Exportable `postman_collection.json` mappings mirroring live structural deployments securely!

### Security
- Augmented API mapping structural boundaries inside `POST /api/users` checking headers for `Authorization Bearer` tokens tightly prior to Prisma interactions structurally.

---

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- Converted SQLite storage architectures mapping entirely to a cloud-native AWS remote PostgreSQL database structural cluster.

### Fixed
- Reverted erroneous Zod logic crashing `users` API when legacy structural arrays (`name`) were natively ignored by the new mapping schema constraints!

---

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- The bare-bones primitive NextJS Application structure implementing foundational React layouts securely.
- Basic mock mathematical bounds running over native `__tests__/math.test.ts`.

> By linking rigorous Pull Requests logically backwards into the `CHANGELOG`, Developer Teams scale symmetrically effectively decoupling integration regressions mapping transparently over historical architectures visually securely.
