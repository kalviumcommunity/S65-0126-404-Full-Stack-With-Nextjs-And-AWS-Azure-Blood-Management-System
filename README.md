# 🩸 Real-Time Blood Donation & Inventory Management Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

India’s blood banks and hospitals often face shortages due to poor coordination and outdated inventory systems. During emergencies, delays in finding available blood units can cost lives.

This project aims to build a **real-time full-stack web platform** that connects:

- Blood donors  
- Hospitals / blood banks  
- NGOs / administrators  

The platform enables live inventory tracking, location-based search, and secure role-based access.
